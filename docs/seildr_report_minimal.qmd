# Epidemiological Analysis under Minimal Seeding

This report summarizes SEILDR stochastic model outcomes using **minimal initial seeding conditions**:

- **Initial infectious individuals:** 2  
- **Initial latent carriers:** 10  
- **Mortality rates tested:** 0.1 to 0.8  
- **Extinction threshold:** 20 cumulative deaths

We compare three management scenarios:

- **do_nothing**: no interventions (no isolation, biosecurity, or testing applied).
- **isolation_only**: infectious individuals isolated upon clinical detection.
- **isolation_biosecurity**: combines isolation with improved cross-aviary biosecurity.

# 1. Infectious Seeding Heatmaps (Latent = 10)

## `do_nothing`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/infectious/do_nothing_l10_heatmap_infectious.png)

- Rapid rise in cumulative deaths with increasing mortality.
- Limited buffering effect at low infectious seeding due to no interventions.
- Even small mortality increases lead to sharp elevation in final deaths.

---

## `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/infectious/isolation_biosecurity_l10_heatmap_infectious.png)

- Substantial mitigation across entire mortality range.
- Cumulative deaths remain <35 even at extreme mortality values.
- Biosecurity acts synergistically with isolation to prevent amplification.

---

## `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/infectious/isolation_only_l10_heatmap_infectious.png)

- Intermediate control relative to full biosecurity.
- Steady reduction but still progressive deaths at high mortality rates.
- Isolation alone insufficient to fully contain aggressive mortality strains.

---

# 2. Latent Seeding Heatmaps (Infectious = 2)

## `do_nothing`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/latent/do_nothing_i2_heatmap_latent.png)

- Strong influence of latent seeding magnitude.
- High latent loads push final deaths toward maximal outbreak levels.
- With minimal infectious seeding, latent pool still dominates long-term risk.

---

## `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/latent/isolation_biosecurity_i2_heatmap_latent.png)

- Superior flattening across all latent load levels.
- High resilience to latent carrier introduction.
- Deaths remain well-controlled (<40) even under worst case.

---

## `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/latent/isolation_only_i2_heatmap_latent.png)

- Partial buffering.
- Moderate rise in cumulative deaths with increasing latent carriers.
- Still considerable amplification at higher latent values.

---

# 3. Stability Maps (Variance Heatmaps)

## `do_nothing`

![](../results/summaries/stability/do_nothing_i2_stability_map.png)

- Variance rises with both mortality and latent load.
- Unstable zones appear as mortality exceeds 0.5.
- No intervention leads to highly sensitive outbreak equilibrium.

---

## `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/stability/isolation_biosecurity_i2_stability_map.png)

- Stability is greatly improved.
- Variance remains low throughout full parameter grid.
- Management produces highly predictable epidemic outcomes.

---

## `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/stability/isolation_only_i2_stability_map.png)

- Intermediate variance profiles.
- Some volatility at upper mortality and latent levels.
- Isolation reduces variability but fails to fully stabilize dynamics.

---

# 4. Extinction Maps (All scenarios, threshold = 20)

## `do_nothing`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/do_nothing_extinction_map.png)

- Extinction unlikely at mortality above 0.2.
- Full epidemic amplification dominates parameter space.

## `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/isolation_biosecurity_extinction_map.png)

- Large extinction-safe zone extending into intermediate mortality values.
- Improved cross-aviary control significantly shifts outbreak threshold.

## `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/isolation_only_extinction_map.png)

- Modest extinction expansion relative to do_nothing.
- Limited extinction capacity above mortality 0.3.
- Isolation alone insufficient for aggressive viral strains.

---

#  Biological Interpretation

- Even minimal initial seeding can generate substantial outbreaks depending on mortality and latent pool size.
- Reactivation dynamics remain critical amplifiers in stochastic simulations, even though it is set at a very low rate (0.00027)
- Biosecurity interventions consistently offer stronger suppression than isolation alone.
- Threshold and stability maps highlight highly non-linear tipping points near mortality 0.3–0.5.
- Management decisions targeting latent pool reduction and cross-aviary transmission have strongest payoff.

## Reactivation Rate Interpretation

The parameter used for daily reactivation probability per latent carrier is:

$$
P_{\text{reactivation daily}} = 0.00027
$$

### Annualized Expectation

Since this is a Bernoulli process repeated daily, the expected number of reactivations per bird per year (365 days) is approximately:

$$
E_{\text{yearly}} = 365 \times 0.00027 \approx 0.0985
$$

### Interpretation

- Each latent bird has about a **9.85% chance** of reactivating in any given year.
- Or said differently:
  - On average, about **1 reactivation event every 10 years per bird**.
- This is substantially lower than **1 reactivation per bird per year**, which would correspond to:

$$
P_{\text{reactivation daily}} \approx \frac{1}{365} \approx 0.00274
$$

### Summary Table

| Reactivation Daily Rate | Annual Probability | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0.00027 | ~9.85% per year | 1 event every ~10 years |
| 0.00274 | ~63% per year | ~1 event per year |


### Biological Reality

The chosen value ($0.00027$) is biologically reasonable if assuming:

- Chronic latency is generally stable.
- Reactivation is rare, often triggered by major stressors or immunosuppression.
- Parrots may remain latently infected for many years without reactivation.

This is consistent with long-term latency models in herpesviruses, where reactivation can occur unpredictably and infrequently over the host's lifespan.
