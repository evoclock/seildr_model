# Executive Summary

This technical report summarizes a representative scenario exploration using the SEILDR stochastic transmission model for Pacheco's disease in captive parrot populations. The model simulates long-term outbreak dynamics under alternative management strategies.

We illustrate key transmission, mortality, and stochastic outcome patterns across:

- **Three management scenarios:**
  - `do_nothing` — No additional interventions including testing, isolation, extended biosecurity protocols, or active management interventions.
  - `isolation_only` — Isolation of symptomatic birds, limited biosecurity reinforcement.
  - `isolation_biosecurity` — Full application of both isolation and elevated biosecurity protocols.

- **Multiple parameter combinations** varying:
  - Mortality risk
  - Initial seeding size of infectious and latent carriers

The outputs allow direct visual interpretation of outbreak risk under varying biological and operational conditions.

# Scenario 1 — Heatmaps (Mortality vs Infectious)

We first examine how mortality and initial number of infectious birds affect cumulative outbreak size (mean deaths) at fixed latent carrier load (30 birds).

### `do_nothing`

### `isolation_only`

### `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/infectious/isolation_biosecurity_l30_heatmap_infectious.png)

**Key observations:**

- All scenarios show strong monotonic escalation of deaths with increasing mortality rate.
- Management interventions progressively compress overall outbreak sizes.
- `isolation_biosecurity` achieves substantial risk reduction across entire parameter space.

# Scenario 2 — Heatmaps (Mortality vs Latent Carriers)

We next explore how mortality interacts with latent carrier seeding when fixing initial infectious count at 10 birds.

### `do_nothing`

### `isolation_only`

### `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/heatmaps/latent/isolation_biosecurity_i10_heatmap_latent.png)

**Key observations:**

- Latent carriers exert non-linear amplification of outbreak magnitude.
- Higher latent seeding sharply increases risk at intermediate mortality levels.
- Full biosecurity is especially effective at containing risk even at high latent burden.

# Scenario 3 — Stability Maps

We map standard deviation of deaths across replicates to assess stochastic volatility of outcomes. High variance indicates unstable regions highly sensitive to random epidemic dynamics.

### `do_nothing`

### `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/stability/isolation_only_i10_stability_map.png)

### `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/stability/isolation_biosecurity_i10_stability_map.png)

**Key observations:**

- Instability zones (high variance) cluster at intermediate mortality rates.
- Latent carrier burden amplifies stochasticity when not controlled.
- Management consistently reduces variance, indicating improved predictability.

# Scenario 4 — Extinction Threshold Maps

Finally, we classify full extinction vs sustained outbreak zones using a cumulative death threshold of 20 birds at 3 years from time point zero.

### `do_nothing`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/do_nothing_extinction_map.png)

### `isolation_only`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/isolation_only_extinction_map.png)

### `isolation_biosecurity`

![](../results/summaries/thresholds/isolation_biosecurity_extinction_map.png)

**Key observations:**

- Without intervention, extinction is only likely at lowest mortality and latent seeding.
- `isolation_biosecurity` expands extinction-safe parameter space dramatically.
- This suggests its value as a robust preventive management layer.

# Management Implications Summary

| Scenario            | Stability | Extinction Range | Maximum Deaths |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| `do_nothing`         | High stochasticity | Extremely narrow | 60–90 deaths |
| `isolation_only`     | Moderate control | Modest expansion | 50–80 deaths |
| `isolation_biosecurity` | Strong control | Broad extinction buffer | 30–60 deaths |

The reality is that a mixture of all 4 genotypes may exist in a population with different mortality rates associated with each. However, what must not be understimated is the ability to generate new recombinant strains to which currently uninfected birds might not have immunity or ability to seroconvert to. The reported maximum number of deaths presented here is strictly for this subset of parameter combinations over the space of 3 years, other combinations of parameters were considered (480 total combinations). The scenario presented here represents an intermediate number of latent carrier birds, a scenario with a lower number of latent and infected birds is also downloadable via the README.md file
